  "instructions": {
    "Warm-up: Dead Hang": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Grab bar shoulder-width, hang with knees bent if needed.</p><p><b>Do it:</b> Hang with shoulders \"set\" (pulled slightly down, not jammed into ears). Keep ribs down, light brace. Breathe slowly.</p><p><b>Goal:</b> Build grip strength and shoulder tolerance for pull-ups.</p>",

    "Warm-up: Scapular Work": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hang from bar, elbows locked straight.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Pull shoulder blades down and back (like putting them in your back pockets). Body rises slightly. Return to relaxed hang.</p><p><b>Key:</b> Do NOT bend elbows. This is purely a shoulder blade movement.</p>",

    "Warm-up: Scapular Pull-ups": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hang from bar, elbows locked straight.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Pull shoulder blades down and back (like putting them in your back pockets). Body rises slightly. Return to relaxed hang.</p><p><b>Key:</b> Do NOT bend elbows. This is purely a shoulder blade movement.</p>",

    "Warm-up: Scapular Push-ups": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Get in push-up position with arms straight.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Let your shoulder blades come together (chest sinks slightly), then push them apart (upper back rounds slightly).</p><p><b>Key:</b> Arms stay straight the whole time. Only your shoulder blades move.</p>",

    "Warm-up: Prone Y-T-W": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Lie face down on bench or floor. Light weights or none.</p><p><b>Y:</b> Arms angled overhead like a \"Y\". Lift, pause 1 sec, lower.</p><p><b>T:</b> Arms straight out to sides like a \"T\". Lift, pause, lower.</p><p><b>W:</b> Elbows bent, squeeze shoulder blades down/back like making a \"W\".</p><p><b>Do 8 of each shape.</b></p>",

    "Ramp Sets": "<p><b>What:</b> 2-4 light warm-up sets for your first barbell exercise.</p><p><b>How:</b> Start with empty bar, gradually increase weight each set.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Empty bar → 50% → 70% → 85% of working weight.</p><p><b>Goal:</b> Groove the movement pattern and prepare your muscles.</p><p>Take your time, then tap SET DONE when ready to continue.</p>",

    "Shoulder Health: Prone T": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Face down on bench, arms hanging straight down.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Raise arms out to sides (making a T), leading with thumbs up.</p><p><b>Key:</b> Squeeze shoulder blades together at top. Use light weight or none.</p>",

    "Shoulder Health: Prone Y": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Face down on bench, arms hanging straight down.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Raise arms overhead at 45° angle (making a Y), thumbs up.</p><p><b>Key:</b> Keep shoulders away from ears. Control the movement.</p>",

    "Shoulder Health: External Rotation": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Lie on your side. Top arm's elbow pinned to ribs, bent 90°. Hold light weight.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Keeping elbow glued to side, rotate forearm upward toward ceiling.</p><p><b>Key:</b> Slow and controlled. This builds rotator cuff strength.</p>",

    "Arms: DB Curls": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Stand tall, dumbbells at sides, palms forward.</p><p><b>Curl:</b> Bend elbows to bring weights up. Keep upper arms still.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Slow and controlled back to start.</p>",

    "Arms: Overhead Triceps": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hold one dumbbell or kettlebell overhead with both hands.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Bend elbows to lower weight behind head.</p><p><b>Press:</b> Extend arms back to start. Keep elbows pointing up.</p>",

    "Cool-down: Scapular Pull-ups": "<p><b>Easy practice to finish.</b></p><p>Same as warm-up scapular pull-ups, but keep it light and controlled.</p><p>Focus on the mind-muscle connection with your shoulder blades.</p>",

    "Warm-up": "<p><b>Complete these in order:</b></p><p>1. <b>Dead Hang</b> - 2×15-30s. Grip the bar, hang with shoulders engaged (not shrugged to ears). Breathe slowly.</p><p>2. <b>Scapular Pull-ups</b> - 2×6-10. From hang, pull shoulder blades down and back without bending elbows. Small movement, big activation.</p><p>3. <b>Scapular Push-ups</b> - 2×8-12. In push-up position, let shoulder blades come together, then push them apart. Arms stay straight.</p><p>4. <b>Prone Y-T-W</b> - 1 round of 8 each. Face down, make Y/T/W shapes with arms, squeezing shoulder blades.</p><p>5. <b>Ramp Sets</b> - 2-4 light sets of your first barbell exercise, gradually increasing weight.</p>",

    "Dead Hang": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Grab bar shoulder-width, hang with knees bent if needed.</p><p><b>Do it:</b> Hang with shoulders \"set\" (pulled slightly down, not jammed into ears). Keep ribs down, light brace. Breathe slowly.</p><p><b>Goal:</b> Build grip strength and shoulder tolerance for pull-ups.</p>",

    "Scapular Pull-ups": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hang from bar, elbows locked straight.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Pull shoulder blades down and back (like putting them in your back pockets). Body rises slightly. Return to relaxed hang.</p><p><b>Key:</b> Do NOT bend elbows. This is purely a shoulder blade movement.</p>",

    "Top Hold (Chin Over Bar)": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Jump or step to get chin over bar.</p><p><b>Hold:</b> Keep chin over bar, chest lifted, shoulders down. Hold for prescribed time.</p><p><b>Don't:</b> Crank your neck up. Keep eyes forward, let back do the work.</p>",

    "Negative Pull-up": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Jump to top position (chin above bar). Start tight: shoulders down, abs braced.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Descend slowly for prescribed seconds. Control the entire way down. Elbows track toward ribs.</p><p><b>Finish:</b> Full hang with control (don't just drop).</p>",

    "Mid-point Hold": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Jump to top, then lower until elbows are about 90°.</p><p><b>Hold:</b> Keep shoulders down, chest tall. Hold for prescribed time.</p><p><b>Why:</b> Strengthens the \"sticking point\" range.</p>",

    "Perfect Singles": "<p><b>What:</b> Single clean pull-ups with full rest between.</p><p><b>Do:</b> Full hang → chin over bar → controlled lower. If you can't get chin over, do: jump to top → 2s hold → slow negative.</p><p><b>Rule:</b> NEVER grind. Stop before form breaks down.</p>",

    "Barbell Bench Press": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Eyes under bar, feet flat behind knees, grip just wider than shoulders.</p><p><b>Unrack:</b> Squeeze shoulder blades BACK and DOWN. Hold bar over mid-chest.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Bar to lower chest/sternum, elbows ~45° from torso (not flared out).</p><p><b>Press:</b> Push up and slightly back toward face. Keep blades pinned.</p><p><b>Breathing:</b> Big breath before lowering, hold during press, exhale at top.</p>",

    "Paused Bench Press": "<p>Same as bench press, but:</p><p><b>Pause:</b> After bar touches chest, hold it STILL for 1-2 seconds (no bounce), then press.</p><p><b>Why:</b> Builds strength at the hardest point. Forces good positioning.</p>",

    "Close-Grip Bench Press": "<p><b>Grip:</b> Hands about shoulder-width (closer than regular, but not touching).</p><p><b>Elbows:</b> Keep tucked ~30-45° from torso.</p><p><b>Goal:</b> Triceps strength and bench lockout power.</p>",

    "Standing Barbell OHP": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Feet shoulder-width, bar at upper chest/clavicle, grip just outside shoulders.</p><p><b>Brace:</b> Squeeze glutes, ribs down, light ab brace. Don't lean back!</p><p><b>Press:</b> Bar goes up in near-vertical path. Move head back as it passes, then forward under bar at top.</p>",

    "Barbell Row (Pause)": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Feet hip-width, hinge at hips until torso ~30-45° to floor. Neutral spine.</p><p><b>Row:</b> Pull bar to lower ribs/upper stomach. Elbows back. <b>Pause 1 second at top.</b></p><p><b>Lower:</b> Control down. Don't jerk with lower back.</p><p><b>Cues:</b> \"Proud chest.\" \"Pull elbows to hips.\" \"No shrugging.\"</p>",

    "Barbell Row (Tempo)": "<p>Same as barbell row, but:</p><p><b>Tempo:</b> Lower the bar for 3 FULL SECONDS every rep.</p><p><b>Why:</b> Increases difficulty without more weight. Builds back control.</p>",

    "Incline Dumbbell Press": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Bench at low incline, DBs at upper chest, feet planted.</p><p><b>Press:</b> Push up and slightly together. Don't bang DBs at top.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Slow, controlled, elbows ~45° from torso.</p>",

    "One-Arm Dumbbell Row": "<p><b>Setup:</b> One knee + hand on bench, spine long. Other hand holds DB.</p><p><b>Row:</b> Pull DB toward hip. <b>Pause 1 second at top.</b></p><p><b>Lower:</b> Slow down, let shoulder blade stretch at bottom.</p><p><b>Key:</b> Keep hips mostly square (don't twist torso).</p>",

    "Push-ups": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hands under shoulders (or slightly wider). Body straight from head to heels.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Chest toward floor, elbows ~30-45° from torso.</p><p><b>Press:</b> Push floor away. Keep core braced, no sagging hips.</p><p><b>Options:</b> Hands on bench (easier) or feet elevated (harder).</p>",

    "Rear Delt Fly": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hinge at hips, torso angled down, DBs hang below shoulders.</p><p><b>Move:</b> Raise arms out to sides making a \"T\", slight elbow bend.</p><p><b>Control:</b> Slow, strict reps. Stop before shrugging.</p>",

    "Lateral Raise": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Stand tall, slight elbow bend, DBs at sides.</p><p><b>Raise:</b> Lift to shoulder height. Lead with elbows, not hands.</p><p><b>Key:</b> No swinging. Use lighter weight if needed.</p>",

    "Curls": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Stand tall, elbows close to sides.</p><p><b>Curl:</b> Bring weight up by bending elbows only. Don't lean back or swing.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Slow and controlled.</p>",

    "Hammer Curl": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hold DBs with thumbs up (neutral grip).</p><p><b>Curl:</b> Raise without rotating wrist. Elbow stays close to side.</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> Trains forearms and elbow flexors for pull-up support.</p>",

    "Skull Crushers": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Lie on bench, hold bar above chest, elbows pointed up.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Bend elbows, bring bar toward forehead/top of head. Upper arms stay still.</p><p><b>Press:</b> Extend elbows to return. Smooth and controlled.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If elbows hurt, switch to close-grip bench.</p>",

    "Overhead Triceps Extension": "<p><b>Setup:</b> Hold one KB/DB overhead with both hands.</p><p><b>Lower:</b> Bend elbows, bring weight behind head with control.</p><p><b>Raise:</b> Extend elbows back to overhead. Keep ribs down.</p>",

    "Shoulder Health Block": "<p><b>Do 2 rounds with light weight (or bodyweight):</b></p><p>• <b>Prone T Raises:</b> 12-20 reps. Face down on bench, arms out to sides, lift with shoulder blades.</p><p>• <b>Prone Y Raises:</b> 10-15 reps. Face down, arms in Y shape, lift slowly.</p><p>• <b>Side-lying External Rotation:</b> 12-20/side. Lie on side, top elbow pinned to ribs, rotate forearm up.</p><p><b>Goal:</b> Control and activation, not load.</p>",

    "Arms Superset": "<p><b>Do 3 rounds, minimal rest between exercises:</b></p><p>• <b>DB Curls:</b> 10-15 reps</p><p>• <b>Overhead Triceps Extension:</b> 10-15 reps</p><p><b>Rest 45-75 seconds between rounds.</b></p>",

    "Hanging Reinforcement": "<p><b>Easy practice to reinforce pull-up mechanics:</b></p><p>• <b>Dead Hang:</b> 2×20-40 seconds</p><p>• <b>Scapular Pull-ups:</b> 2×6-10 reps</p><p><b>Keep it easy.</b> This is groove practice, not a workout.</p>",

    "Rest": "<p><b>Rest time.</b></p><p>Walk around, breathe, hydrate. Shake out your arms.</p><p>Mentally prepare for the next set.</p>",

    "Finish": "<p><b>Great work!</b></p><p>Hydrate, do some easy shoulder circles.</p><p>Consider noting your main lift weights for next time.</p>"
